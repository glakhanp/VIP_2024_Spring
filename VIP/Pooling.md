Pooling is a technique implemented often within convolutional neural networks to isolate the most prominent feature within a feature map?
- Honestly we don't know why this works

Mainly pooling can help reduce computations and speed up our network 

Max Pooling can be harmful at times too
- It is not a global truth, but rather a technique to test when creating a neural network
