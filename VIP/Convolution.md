Within the context of mathematical convolution is a special way to multiply two matrices together

Within the context of image processing convolution is a method used to multiply the values of an image and some filter together for some filtered output. 

Convolution is often confused with cross correlation however. The difference between the two is that cross correlation is when you take the elementwise multiplication and sum of the image with the filter starting at the top left corner of both the image and the filter and moving across. 

With convolution however, the cross correlation filter is flipped across the x and y axes, which results in different values. 

Within the context of deep learning, there isn't a large mathematical difference between the two since the model can learn the filter wether it's flipped or not, however, applying cross correlation is simpler to do.
